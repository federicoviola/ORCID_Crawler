ORCID_Crawler
=============

A simple crawler for grasping the ORCID data.

The crawler traverses all the ORCID data records from the starting ID "000000015000000" to the ending ID "000000035000000" (The last position check sum needs to be calculated).
<br />The <a href="https://github.com/scholrly/orcid-python">orcid-python</a> module has been imported.
<br />Note that, all the data grasping should obey the <a href="http://orcid.org/legal">ORCID Terms of Use</a>.
